# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its clients. Some of the financial plans Artemis Financial handles includes savings, retirement, investment, and insurance. The software requirements involved ensuring all client personal and financial data, and the company's system is protected from any external threats by ensuring the system is following secure practices and guidelines. The company wanted me to examine their software application to identify any security vulnerabilities and how to mitigate any vulneribilities in a series of reports. 

# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I did well in documenting and assessing the risk of the security vulnerabilities found along with creating a mitigation plan to help Artemis Financial systems stay reputable and secure. It is important to code securely as it prevents any attacks and exploiting sensitive data. The company will be valuable as having a secure system will create a trusting relationship with clients as they would more likely stay loyal to the company if they know their information is always secure. 

# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The part of the vulnerability assessment that was helpful to me was it provided me a layout to follow to ensure that I touched on all necessary components of secure practices and figured out how they could be integrated into the financial system.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by implementing security measures such as encryption to protect sensitive data from being easily accessible to any user. For the future I would use automated tools to my advantage to help me assess vulnerabilties and montior the system to ensure the system is continously secure. I would also look into other automated tools that can predict any threats to prevent an attack before it could occur. 

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I made certain the application was functional and secure performing a manual review of the code and dependency checks to identify any vulnerabilties. After refactoring running another dependency check is good to make sure no new vulneribilities occur.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Some resources I used that could be helpful in future assignments is the OWASP Dependency Check. It helped me learn that a lot of the libraries used in the program were not up to date and that is a security risk to the program. Having this tool under my belt for future assignments will help me greatly.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I might show future employers from this assignment how I was able to identify security vulnerabilties and what I would plan to do about them to create a more secure system.
